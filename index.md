I liked the points made in this tedtalk and I felt that they reflected the lessons learnt so far in class this term.

I found the code from the padlock projects really helpful in coding my puzzle box

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
To create a small device/game that is simple and entertaining.

### Design concept 1 ###

My first idea was an electronic pet. lots of people have been wanting pets in the last few weeks since we have been stuck inside. I think that an electronic household pet could be helpful for people who can't get a pet right now. I would want the pet to have a few simple commands that had randomised outcomes. My idea is to create a toy where the microbit LEDs are the interface.

### Design concept 2 ###
My second idea was an alarmed cookie jar to stop people stealing your snacks.  

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

This is the first code that I developed and tested. It's a simple circus that when closed shows a smiley face and when open shows a cross and makes an alerting noise

I then placed all of the wires within the box to make it look cleaner.

I added to the code a function to deactivate the alarm while the A button is pressed.

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
